# Use Dev Proxy for API design: build better APIs from the start

Designing APIs is crucial to building reliable, scalable applications, but the process can be challenging without the right tools. Dev Proxy simplifies the API design process, enabling you to prototype, simulate, and refine your API before you fully implement it. With Dev Proxy, you can create, test, and document your API early, ensuring it meets the needs of your app and users from day one.

## Why use Dev Proxy for API design?

Dev Proxy empowers developers to simulate API behavior in real-time, even before the actual API exists. By using Dev Proxy during the design phase, you can:

- **Prototype faster**: Build your app while designing the API, eliminating delays, and reducing bottlenecks in development.
- **Ensure reliability**: Identify potential issues with API interactions, such as response handling and edge cases, early in the design process.
- **Collaborate seamlessly**: Share API mocks and specifications with your team, enabling clear communication and alignment throughout development.
- **Accelerate iteration**: Quickly adapt your API design based on feedback and testing, improving agility and reducing costly changes later in the process.

## Key Dev Proxy features for API design

Dev Proxy offers a range of features to support API design, including:

### [Mock API responses](../how-to/mock-responses.md)

Simulate API responses instantly without the need for a live backend. Test how your app behaves with different response scenarios, giving you the flexibility to build and refine both the API and the app simultaneously.

### [Generate OpenAPI specifications](../how-to/generate-openapi-spec.md)

Automatically generate API documentation, ensuring that your API design is clearly defined and easy to share with stakeholders. Having API documentation helps you create well-structured, self-explanatory APIs that are easy to adopt.

### [Simulate CRUD APIs](../how-to/simulate-crud-api.md)

Design and test Create-, Read-, Update-, and Delete APIs without a functioning backend. Verify how your API handles functionality from the ground up without guessing and waiting for the backend to be ready.

### [Record and export Dev Proxy activity](../how-to/record-and-export-proxy-activity.md)

Track all API interactions and export them for review, ensuring that your API design evolves based on real-world app usage. Use this data to refine and optimize your API before it goes live.

## Start designing better APIs today

Dev Proxy makes API design faster, smarter, and more efficient. With its powerful simulation and mock capabilities, you can design robust APIs that meet your app's needs right from the start. Whether you're building new APIs or refining existing ones, Dev Proxy provides the tools to get it right the first time.
