# Use Dev Proxy for API testing: validate API performance and reliability with confidence

Testing APIs is essential to building resilient, high-performing applications that can handle real-world scenarios and unexpected conditions. Dev Proxy equips you with the tools to test your API's behavior, providing insights into its performance, error handling, and overall robustness before it's live. With Dev Proxy, you can thoroughly evaluate your API's reliability, identify potential issues, and optimize performance.

## Why Use Dev Proxy for API testing?

Dev Proxy allows you to simulate real-world API conditions and errors, ensuring that your API performs consistently under various scenarios. By using Dev Proxy for API testing, you can:

- **Identify vulnerabilities early**: Detect and address weaknesses before they reach your users by simulating diverse conditions like network delays, rate limiting, and error responses.
- **Improve app reliability**: Test how your application handles different API responses, helping you create apps that respond smoothly to unexpected issues.
- **Streamline testing**: Simplify your testing process by running comprehensive API simulations without a dedicated backend, saving time and reducing testing dependencies.

## Key Dev Proxy features for API testing

Dev Proxy offers a range of features to support API testing, enabling you to validate your API's performance, reliability, and error handling under various conditions.

### [Simulate API error responses](../how-to/test-my-app-with-random-errors.md)

Test how your application manages various error responses (for example, 400 and 500 HTTP errors), enabling you to design effective error-handling logic and failover mechanisms.

### [Simulate API throttling (rate-limiting)](../how-to/simulate-rate-limit-api-responses.md)

Simulate rate-limit responses to ensure your app gracefully handles throttling and retry scenarios, minimizing disruptions to the user experience.

### [Simulate slow APIs](../how-to/simulate-slow-api-responses.md)

Introduce network latency to see how your app performs under slow API conditions, helping you design smoother user interfaces and efficient timeout handling.

### [Mock API responses](../how-to/mock-responses.md)

Easily create mock responses for testing, allowing you to test the API's expected behavior in a controlled environment and simulate different response types and structures.
