# Test a JavaScript client-side web application that calls Microsoft Graph

In this tutorial, you learn how to use Dev Proxy to test a sample JavaScript client-side web application that calls Microsoft Graph.

## Prerequisites

This part of the tutorial assumes that you installed and configured Dev Proxy on your machine. If not, do that [now](../get-started.md).

To follow this tutorial, you need:

- Microsoft 365 tenant.
- Account with permissions to create Microsoft Entra app registrations.
- Git (see [GitHubâ€™s set up Git guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git)).
- [nodejs LTS](https://nodejs.org).

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you use a Microsoft 365 Developer Tenant with content packs installed. Get your free tenant by [signing up to the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365/).

## Clone and configure the sample app

- Download the [sample app](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/proxy-samples/tree/main/samples/demo-m365-randomerror-js)
- Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/pnp/proxy-samples/blob/main/samples/demo-m365-randomerror-js/readme.md) to configure the app.

## Start Dev Proxy

Dev Proxy comes with a preset configuration for testing apps that send requests to Microsoft Graph and SharePoint Online APIs.

- Open a command prompt, enter `devproxy --config-file "~appFolder/presets/m365.json"` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to start Dev Proxy with configuration for Microsoft 365.

## Launch the sample app

- Open a command prompt and change to the `samples` directory.
- Enter `npx lite-server` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to start the sample app web server.

The app shows a large Microsoft logo with two buttons below it. A primary button with the text 'With SDK' and a secondary button with the text 'Without SDK'.":::

## Test the sample app

1. In the running app, select the `Without SDK` button.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > If you got an empty page after clicking the `Without SDK` button, check that you have [configured the Azure AD App Registration](https://github.com/microsoft/dev-proxy/tree/main/samples#configure-azure-ad-app-registration). The issue occurs when the `.env` file containing the `Client ID` of your app registration is missing.

1. Select the `Login` button and complete the sign in flow.

  Dev Proxy introduces faults into your application by intercepting requests to Microsoft Graph. It uses 50% chance for failing requests with a random [supported HTTP error status code](../technical-reference/graphrandomerrorplugin.md).
  
  View the proxy output and take a moment to refresh the sample app. See how the sample app handles (or not, in this case) the failures introduced by the proxy.

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop Dev Proxy.
