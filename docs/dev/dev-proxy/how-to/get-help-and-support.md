# Get help and support

The fastest and easiest way of getting in touch with us is via the GitHub Issues list.

Create a [new issue](https://github.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/issues/new) in the repo and provide as much information as you can for us to be able to respond timely to your issue.

If something went wrong or you're seeing unexpected results, raise a [new issue](https://github.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/issues/new) and provide a [minimal reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example). Having a clearly described error helps us respond and solve your issue faster.
