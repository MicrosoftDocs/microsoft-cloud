# Inspect API requests issued by cloud services

When you integrate your application with cloud services, one of the challenges you might face is understanding how the cloud service interacts with the APIs it uses. Being able to inspect API requests is especially important when you're troubleshooting issues or when you're trying to understand how the cloud service works. Typically, it's challenging, because you don't have access to the cloud service's runtime, and you also might not have access to the monitoring tools for the cloud API. By using Dev Proxy and dev tunnels, you can inspect the API requests that cloud services issue to cloud APIs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you continue, install [dev tunnels](/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started) and configure the tool for use.

## How cloud services call cloud APIs

When you integrate your application with cloud services, the cloud service calls your API in the cloud. The following diagram illustrates this scenario:

To inspect API requests that the cloud service issues, you need access to the monitoring tools for the cloud API. Often, you don't have access to these tools. You could work around this limitation, by using a staging environment. However, it's time-consuming to set up and maintain a staging environment. What's more, if you don't own the cloud API, you might not be able to set up a staging environment at all.

## Inspect API requests using Dev Proxy and dev tunnels

By using Dev Proxy and dev tunnels, you can inspect the API requests that the cloud service issues to the cloud API.

:::image type="content" source="../media/cloud-service-api-dev-tunnel-dev-proxy.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows how you can inspect cloud API calls using dev tunnels and Dev Proxy." lightbox="../media/cloud-service-api-dev-tunnel-dev-proxy.png":::

Rather than calling the cloud API directly, you configure the cloud service to call the dev tunnel you run on your local machine (1). You configure dev tunnel to use a host header that Dev Proxy intercepts. Each time the cloud service calls the dev tunnel, it passes the request to Dev Proxy which intercepts it (2). Using the Dev Proxy [RewritePlugin](../technical-reference/rewriteplugin.md), you change the URL of the intercepted request, and forward it to the cloud API (3). The cloud API processes the request and returns a response to Dev Proxy (4). Dev Proxy passes the response to dev tunnel (5), which forwards it to the cloud service (6). Because the request is routed through your local machine, you can inspect its information, including URL, headers, and body, and the response from the cloud API.

## Scenario

Say you want to inspect API requests that a cloud service issues to the demo JSONPlaceholder API located at `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`. By combining Dev Proxy and dev tunnels, you can intercept the requests and inspect their information.

You can inspect the requests either by using dev tunnels inspections tools, or using the Dev Proxy DevToolsPlugin. Both tools use Chrome Dev Tools to show information about intercepted requests and responses. When you use the dev tunnels inspections tools, you see the dev tunnel URL as the request URL. In comparison, when you use the Dev Proxy DevToolsPlugin, you see how Dev Proxy intercepts the request, using either the local or the rewritten URL.

## Inspect API requests using Dev Proxy, dev tunnels, and dev tunnels inspection tools

1. Configure Dev Proxy to intercept requests to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` and `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.local`:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/main/schemas/v0.27.0/rc.schema.json",
      "plugins": [
        {
          "name": "RewritePlugin",
          "enabled": true,
          "pluginPath": "~appFolder/plugins/dev-proxy-plugins.dll",
          "configSection": "rewritePlugin"
        }
      ],
      "urlsToWatch": [
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/*",
        "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.local/*"
      ],
      "rewritePlugin": {
        "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/main/schemas/v0.27.0/rewriteplugin.schema.json",
        "rewritesFile": "devproxy-rewrites.json"
      },
      "logLevel": "information",
      "newVersionNotification": "stable",
      "showSkipMessages": true
    }
    ```

    The configuration file uses the RewritePlugin to rewrite the URL of the intercepted requests. It also configures Dev Proxy to intercept requests to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` and `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.local` URLs.

    > [!NOTE]
    > While it's not necessary to use a `.local` domain, it's a good practice that helps you distinguish between the real and the intercepted requests. Also notice, that for the `.local` domain, you use the HTTP protocol, rather than HTTPS. Dev tunnels doesn't support HTTPS for routing requests to custom host headers on your local machine which is why you need to use HTTP.

1. Create a rewrite file named `devproxy-rewrites.json` that changes the URL of the intercepted requests:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/main/schemas/v0.27.0/rewriteplugin.rewritesfile.schema.json",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "in": {
            "url": "^http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.local(.*)"
          },
          "out": {
            "url": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com$1"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    The rewrite file changes the URL of the intercepted requests from `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.local` to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.

1. Start Dev Proxy by running in the command line `devproxy`.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/inspect-cloud-api-start-dev-proxy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of command line with Dev Proxy running." lightbox="../media/inspect-cloud-api-start-dev-proxy.png":::

1. Start dev tunnel by running in the command line `devtunnel host --host-header jsonplaceholder.typicode.local --port-numbers 8000 --allow-anonymous`.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/inspect-cloud-api-start-dev-tunnel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of command line running Dev Proxy and dev tunnel." lightbox="../media/inspect-cloud-api-start-dev-tunnel.png":::

    Using this command, you open a new dev tunnel on your machine. You map it to the 8000 port which is where Dev Proxy listens for incoming requests. You also specify the host header that Dev Proxy intercepts.

1. Note the URL of the dev tunnel that you can use to configure the cloud service to call your local machine, for example `https://tunnel_id-8000.euw.devtunnels.ms`.
1. In a web browser, open the dev tunnel inspection URL, for example `https://tunnel_id-8000-inspect.euw.devtunnels.ms`.
1. Simulate a cloud service calling the cloud API by using the dev tunnel URL, by running in the command line: `curl https://tunnel_id-8000.euw.devtunnels.ms/posts/1`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice, that the host name corresponds to the URL of the dev tunnel on your machine. The path matches the path of the API you want to inspect.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/inspect-cloud-api-call-dev-tunnel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of command line running Dev Proxy and a dev tunnel, and curl calling the dev tunnel." lightbox="../media/inspect-cloud-api-call-dev-tunnel.png":::

1. Notice how Dev Proxy intercepts the request, and forwards it to the cloud API, eventually returning the response to the client.
1. In the web browser, notice the information about the intercepted request and the response from the cloud API.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice that the recorded request URL is the URL of the dev tunnel. The recorded host header is the host header that Dev Proxy intercepts.

1. Close the dev tunnel and stop Dev Proxy by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in their respective sessions in the command line.

## Inspect API requests using Dev Proxy and DevToolsPlugin

Another way to inspect the API requests that the cloud service issues, is by using the Dev Proxy DevToolsPlugin. The difference between using the DevToolsPlugin and the dev tunnels inspection tools is that the DevToolsPlugin shows how Dev Proxy intercepts the request, using either the local or the rewritten URL.

### Configure Dev Proxy to use the DevToolsPlugin to inspect API requests using the intercepted URL

First, let's configure Dev Proxy to inspect cloud API requests. Let's configure the DevToolsPlugin to show the information about the URL before Dev Proxy rewrites it.

1. Update the Dev Proxy configuration file to use the DevToolsPlugin:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/main/schemas/v0.27.0/rc.schema.json",
      "plugins": [
        {
          "name": "DevToolsPlugin",
          "enabled": true,
          "pluginPath": "~appFolder/plugins/dev-proxy-plugins.dll"
        },
        {
          "name": "RewritePlugin",
          "enabled": true,
          "pluginPath": "~appFolder/plugins/dev-proxy-plugins.dll",
          "configSection": "rewritePlugin"
        }
      ],
      "urlsToWatch": [
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/*",
        "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.local/*"
      ],
      "rewritePlugin": {
        "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/main/schemas/v0.27.0/rewriteplugin.schema.json",
        "rewritesFile": "devproxy-rewrites.json"
      },
      "logLevel": "information",
      "newVersionNotification": "stable",
      "showSkipMessages": true
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice, that we add the DevToolsPlugin before the RewritePlugin. By adding the DevToolsPlugin first, it shows the information about the intercepted request before it's rewritten.

1. Start Dev Proxy by running in the command line `devproxy`. Notice that Dev Proxy opens a web browser window with Chrome Dev Tools visible.
1. Start dev tunnel by running in the command line `devtunnel host --host-header jsonplaceholder.typicode.local --port-numbers 8000 --allow-anonymous`.
1. Simulate a cloud service calling the cloud API by using the dev tunnel URL, by running in the command line: `curl https://tunnel_id-8000.euw.devtunnels.ms/posts/1`.
1. In the web browser with Chrome Dev Tools, notice the information about the intercepted request and the response from the cloud API.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/inspect-cloud-api-inspect-dev-proxy-first.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a web browser with Dev Proxy inspections tools showing the intercepted request." lightbox="../media/inspect-cloud-api-inspect-dev-proxy-first.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice that the recorded request URL is the URL of the cloud API. The recorded host header is the host header that Dev Proxy intercepts.

1. Close the dev tunnel and stop Dev Proxy by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in their respective sessions in the command line.

### Configure Dev Proxy to use the DevToolsPlugin to inspect API requests using the rewritten URL

Next, let's update Dev Proxy configuration to show the information about the rewritten URL.

1. Update the Dev Proxy configuration file by moving the DevToolsPlugin after the RewritePlugin:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/main/schemas/v0.27.0/rc.schema.json",
      "plugins": [
        {
          "name": "RewritePlugin",
          "enabled": true,
          "pluginPath": "~appFolder/plugins/dev-proxy-plugins.dll",
          "configSection": "rewritePlugin"
        },
        {
          "name": "DevToolsPlugin",
          "enabled": true,
          "pluginPath": "~appFolder/plugins/dev-proxy-plugins.dll"
        }
      ],
      "urlsToWatch": [
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/*",
        "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.local/*"
      ],
      "rewritePlugin": {
        "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/dev-proxy/main/schemas/v0.27.0/rewriteplugin.schema.json",
        "rewritesFile": "devproxy-rewrites.json"
      },
      "logLevel": "information",
      "newVersionNotification": "stable",
      "showSkipMessages": true
    }
    ```

1. Start Dev Proxy by running in the command line `devproxy`. Notice that Dev Proxy opens a web browser window with Chrome Dev Tools visible.
1. Start dev tunnel by running in the command line `devtunnel host --host-header jsonplaceholder.typicode.local --port-numbers 8000 --allow-anonymous`.
1. Simulate a cloud service calling the cloud API by using the dev tunnel URL, by running in the command line: `curl https://tunnel_id-8000.euw.devtunnels.ms/posts/1`.
1. In the web browser with Chrome Dev Tools, notice the information about the intercepted request and the response from the cloud API.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/inspect-cloud-api-inspect-dev-proxy-second.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a web browser with Dev Proxy inspections tools showing the intercepted request with cloud API URLs." lightbox="../media/inspect-cloud-api-inspect-dev-proxy-second.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice that both the recorded request URL, and the host header show the URL of the cloud API.

1. Close the dev tunnel and stop Dev Proxy by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in their respective sessions in the command line.

## Summary

By using Dev Proxy and dev tunnels, you can inspect the API requests that cloud services issue to cloud APIs. You can use either dev tunnels inspection tools, or the Dev Proxy DevToolsPlugin to inspect the requests. Both tools show you the information about the intercepted requests, including the URL, headers and body, and the response from the cloud API. By using Dev Proxy and dev tunnels, you can better understand how cloud services interact with cloud APIs, and troubleshoot issues more effectively.
