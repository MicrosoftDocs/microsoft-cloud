## Extend Copilot

Copilot offers a comprehensive range of features right out of the box, yet many users depend on external tools, services, and data to carry out tasks. To bridge this gap, Copilot can be extended using plugins, connectors, or message extensions.

:::image type="content" source="isv/media/copilot-across-microsoft-cloud-extend.png" alt-text="A diagram showing extend options for a Copilot across the Microsoft Cloud." border="false" :::

### Benefits of extending Copilot

By extending Copilot, developers can integrate external data directly to minimize user context shifts while enhancing productivity and collaboration.  Copilot can also be extended to provide a new way for developers to surface external data directly in Microsoft products that users use every day. For instance, enterprises and ISVs can build plugins to integrate their own line-of-business APIs and data directly into Copilot.

Adding plugins, connectors, or message extensions to Copilot helps users make the most out of these AI assistants. Users can more easily discover and work with enterprise data, tools, and services using natural language, which improves productivity and enhances teamwork.

#### Extending with Plugins

Plugins allow users to interact directly with APIs and services enhancing the capabilities of Copilot and broadening its range of functionality by pulling in external data. For example, plugins can enable Copilot to retrieve real-time data, such as the latest news coverage on a product launch, or knowledge-based information such as a team's project items.

:::image type="content" source="isv/media/api-data-is-processed-by-copilot.png" alt-text="A diagram showing Microsoft Copilot interacting with a plugin." border="false" :::

One example of plugins is Power Platform connectors which offer a set of prebuilt actions and triggers for developers to build their own apps and workflows. They can be used to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot in Power Platform experiences with data from external apps.

:::image type="content" source="isv/media/power-platform-connector.png" alt-text="A diagram showing the key tasks that a Power Platform connector performs." border="false" :::

Developers can also create plugins that use schemas to add custom functionality to Copilot experiences by connecting their own application data to Microsoft Copilot. Plugins enable a Copilot experience to interact with your own APIs, enhancing the experience with the ability to perform a wide range of actions.

#### Extending with Microsoft Graph connectors

Microsoft Graph connectors import external content into Microsoft 365. Once the content is imported, all of Microsoft 365 including search, context IQ, microsoft365.com, and Microsoft 365 Copilot can access the content. Microsoft Graph connectors are responsible for three key tasks:

1. Creating an external connection in Microsoft 365
1. Defining a schema for the external content
1. Managing external content that's imported into Microsoft 365

#### Extending with message extensions

Message extensions allow users to interact with enterprise services through Microsoft Teams chats. They can search or initiate actions in an external service and post that information, in the form of adaptive cards, into a Teams message. By using message extensions, you can extend the built-in functionality of Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Build your own Copilot

In addition to adopting and extending Microsoft Copilot, a custom AI copilot can be created to create a personalized conversational AI experience for users using Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and other Microsoft Cloud technologies. A custom copilot can integrate company data and documents, retrieve real-time data from external APIs, and be embedded in company applications. For example, a custom copilot can be built to provide a chat interface to access help desk tickets and knowledge base articles. Rather than using traditional search techniques or navigating across multiple applications, users can use the conversational UI provided by the custom Copilot to find the information they need.

:::image type="content" source="isv/media/copilot-across-microsoft-cloud-build.png" alt-text="A diagram showing the build options for creating a custom Copilot." border="false" :::
