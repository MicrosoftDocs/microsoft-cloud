# Tutorial: Integrate Azure Communication Services Calling into a React App

In this exercise you'll add the [ACS UI calling composite](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/composites-call-joinexistingcall--join-existing-call) into a React app to enable making audio/video calls from a custom app into a Microsoft Teams meeting.

1. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in. If you don't already have a GitHub account, you can select the **Sign up** option to create one.

1. Visit the [Microsoft Cloud GitHub Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftCloud).

1. Select the **Fork** option to add the repository to your desired GitHub organization/account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/fork-repo.png" alt-text="Fork a Repository":::

1. Run the following command to clone this repository to your machine. Replace *<YOUR_ORG_NAME>* with your GitHub organization/account name.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG_NAME>/MicrosoftCloud
    ```

1. Open the *samples/acs-to-teams-meeting* project folder in Visual Studio Code.

1. Expand the *client/react* folder.

1. Open the *package.json* file in VS Code and note the following ACS packages are included:

    ```console
    @azure/communication-common 
    @azure/communication-react
    ``` 

1. Double-check that you have *npm 10* or higher installed by opening a terminal window and running the following command:

    ```console
    npm --version
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't have *npm 10* or higher installed you can update npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm`.

1. Open a terminal window and run the `npm install` command in the *react* folder to install the application dependencies.

1. Open *App.tsx* and take a moment to explore the imports at the top of the file. These handle importing ACS security and audio/video calling symbols that will be used in the app.

    ```typescript
    import { 
        AzureCommunicationTokenCredential,
        CommunicationUserIdentifier 
    } from '@azure/communication-common';
    import {  
      CallComposite, 
      fromFlatCommunicationIdentifier, 
      useAzureCommunicationCallAdapter 
    } from '@azure/communication-react';
    import React, { useState, useMemo, useEffect } from 'react';
    import './App.css';
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You'll see how the `CallComposite` component is used later in this exercise. It provides the core UI functionality for Azure Communication Services to enable making an audio/video call from the app into a Microsoft Teams meeting.

1. Locate the `App` component and perform the following tasks:
    - Take a moment to examine the `useState` definitions in the component.
    - Replace the `userId` `useState` function's empty quotes with the ACS user identity value you copied in the previous exercise.
    - Replace the `token` `useState` function's empty quotes with the ACS token value you copied in the previous exercise.
    - Replace the `teamsMeetingLink` `useState` function's empty quotes with the Teams meeting link value you copied in the previous exercise.

    ```typescript
    // Replace '' with the ACS user identity value
    const [userId, setUserId] = useState<string>('');

    // Replace '' with the ACS token value
    const [token, setToken] = useState<string>('');

    // Replace '' with the Teams meeting link value
    const [teamsMeetingLink, setTeamsMeetingLink] = useState<string>('');
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Later in this tutorial you'll see how to retrieve the `userId`, `token`, and `teamsMeetingLink` values dynamically.

1. Take a moment to explore the `useMemo` functions in the `App` component.
    - The `credential` `useMemo` function creates a new `AzureCommunicationTokenCredential` instance once the token has a value.
    - The `callAdapterArgs` `useMemo` function returns an object that has the arguments that are used to make an audio/video call. Notice that is uses the `userId`, `credential`, and `teamsMeetingLink` values in the ACS call arguments.

    ```typescript
    const credential = useMemo(() => {
        if (token) {
            return new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(token)
        }
        return;
    }, [token]);

    const callAdapterArgs = useMemo(() => {
        if (userId && credential && displayName && teamsMeetingLink) {
            return {
                userId: fromFlatCommunicationIdentifier(userId) as CommunicationUserIdentifier,
                displayName,
                credential,
                locator: { meetingLink: teamsMeetingLink },
            }
        }
        return {};
    }, [userId, credential, displayName, teamsMeetingLink]);
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > `useMemo` is used in this scenario because we only want the `AzureCommunicationTokenCredential` object and the call adapter args to be created once as the necessary parameters are passed in. View additional details about [useMemo here](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo).

1. Once the `credentials` and `callAdapterArgs` are ready, the following line handles creating an ACS call adapter using the `useAzureCommunicationCallAdapter` React hook provided by ACS. The `callAdapter` object will be used later in the UI calling composite component.

    ```typescript
    const callAdapter = useAzureCommunicationCallAdapter(callAdapterArgs);
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because `useAzureCommunicationCallAdapter` is a React hook, it won't assign a value to `callAdapter` until the `callAdapterArgs` value is valid.

1. Earlier you assigned the user identity, token, and Teams meeting link to state values in the `App` component. That works fine for now, but in a later exercise you'll see how to dynamically retrieve those values. Since you set the values earlier, comment out the code in the `useEffect` function as shown next. Once you get the Azure Functions running in the next exercises, you'll revisit this code.

    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
        /* Commenting out for now

        const init = async () => {
            setMessage('Getting ACS user');
            //Call Azure Function to get the ACS user identity and token
            let res = await fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_ACS_USER_FUNCTION as string);
            let user = await res.json();
            setUserId(user.userId);
            setToken(user.token);

            setMessage('Getting Teams meeting link...');
            //Call Azure Function to get the meeting link
            res = await fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_TEAMS_MEETING_FUNCTION as string);
            let link = await res.text();
            setTeamsMeetingLink(link);
            setMessage('');
            console.log('Teams meeting link', link);
        }
        init();

        */
    }, []);
    ```

1. Locate the following JSX code. It uses the `CallComposite` symbol you saw imported to render the user interface used to make an audio/video call from the React app into a Teams meeting. The `callAdapter` you explored earlier is passed to its `adapter` property to provide the required arguments.

    ```jsx
    if (callAdapter) {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Contact Customer Service</h1>
                <div className="wrapper">
                    <CallComposite
                        adapter={callAdapter} 
                    />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

1. Save the file before continuing.

1. Run `npm start` in your terminal window to run the application. Ensure you run the command within the *react* folder.

1. After the applications builds you should see a calling UI displayed. Enable selecting your microphone and camera and initiate the call. You should see that you're placed in a waiting room. If you join the meeting you setup earlier in Microsoft Teams, you can allow the guest to enter the meeting.

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> to stop the application. Now that you've successfully run it, let's explore how you can dynamically get the ACS user identity and token and automatically create a Microsoft Teams meeting and return the join URL using Microsoft Graph.
