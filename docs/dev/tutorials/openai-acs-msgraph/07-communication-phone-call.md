# Communication: Making a Phone Call

Integrating Azure Communication Services' phone calling capabilities into a custom Line of Business (LOB) application offers several key benefits to businesses and their users:

- Enables seamless and real-time communication between employees, customers, and partners, directly from within the LOB application, eliminating the need to switch between multiple platforms or devices. 
- Enhances the user experience and improves overall operational efficiency. 
- Facilitates rapid problem resolution, as users can quickly connect with relevant support teams or subject matter experts quickly and easily.

In this exercise, you will:
- Explore the phone calling feature in the application.
- Walk through the code to learn how the phone calling feature is built.

### Using the Phone Calling Feature

1. In the [previous exercise](/microsoft-cloud/dev/tutorials/openai-acs-msgraph/06-communication-create-acs-resource.md?#start-app-services) you created an Azure Communication Services (ACS) resource and started the database, web server, and API server. You also updated the following values in the *.env* file.

    ```
    ACS_CONNECTION_STRING=<ACS_CONNECTION_STRING>
    ACS_PHONE_NUMBER=<ACS_PHONE_NUMBER>
    ACS_EMAIL_ADDRESS=<ACS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>
    CUSTOMER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=<EMAIL_ADDRESS_TO_SEND_EMAIL_TO>
    CUSTOMER_PHONE_NUMBER=<UNITED_STATES_BASED_NUMBER_TO_SEND_SMS_TO>
    ```

    Ensure you've completed the [previous exercise](/microsoft-cloud/dev/tutorials/openai-acs-msgraph/06-communication-create-acs-resource.md?#start-app-services)  before continuing.

1. Go back to the browser (*http://localhost:4200*), locate the datagrid, and select **Contact Customer** followed by **Call Customer** in the first row.

1. Select **Hang Up** to end the call. Select **Close** to close the phone call component.

### Exploring the Phone Calling Code

[!INCLUDE [Note-Open-Files-VS-Code](./includes/tip-open-files-vs-code.md)]

1. Open the *customers-list.component.ts* file. The full path to the file is *client/src/app/customers-list/customers-list.component.ts*.

1. Note that `openCallDialog()` sends a `CustomerCall` message and the customer phone number using an event bus.
    
    ```typescript
    openCallDialog(data: Phone) {
        this.eventBus.emit({ name: Events.CustomerCall, value: data });
    }
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The event bus code can be found in the *eventbus.service.ts* file if you're interested in exploring it more. The full path to the file is *client/src/app/core/eventbus.service.ts*.

1. The header component's `ngOnInit()` function subscribes to the `CustomerCall` event sent by the event bus and displays the phone call component. You can find this code in *header.component.ts*.

    ```typescript
    ngOnInit() {
        this.subscription.add(
            this.eventBus.on(Events.CustomerCall, (data: Phone) => {
                this.callVisible = true; // Show phone call component
                this.callData = data; // Set phone number to call
            })
        );
    }
    ```

1. Open *phone-call.component.ts*. Take a moment to expore the code. The full path to the file is *client/src/app/phone-call/phone-call.component.ts*. Note the following key features:

    - Retrieves an Azure Communication Services access token by calling the `acsService.getAcsToken()` function in `ngOnInit()`;
    - Adds a "phone dialer" to the page. You can see the dialer by clicking on the phone number input in the header.
    - Starts and ends a call using the `startCall()` and `endCall()` functions respectively.

1. Before looking at the code that makes the phone call, let's examine how the ACS access token is retrieved and how phone calling objects are created. Locate the `ngOnInit()` function in *phone-call.component.ts*.

    ```typescript
    async ngOnInit() {
        if (ACS_CONNECTION_STRING) {
            this.subscription.add(
                this.acsService.getAcsToken().subscribe(async (user: AcsUser) => {
                    const callClient = new CallClient();
                    const tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(user.token);
                    this.callAgent = await callClient.createCallAgent(tokenCredential);
                })
            );
        }
    }
    ```

    This function performs the following actions:

    - Retrieves an ACS userId and access token by calling the `acsService.getAcsToken()` function.
    - Once the access token is retrieved, the code performs the following actions:
        - Creates a new instance of `CallClient` and `AzureCommunicationTokenCredential` using the access token.
        - Creates a new instance of `CallAgent` using the `CallClient` and `AzureCommunicationTokenCredential` objects. Later you'll see that `CallAgent` is used to start and end a call.

1. Open *acs.services.ts* and locate the `getAcsToken()` function. The full path to the file is *client/src/app/core/acs.service.ts*. The function makes an HTTP GET request to the `/acstoken` route exposed by the API server.

    ```typescript
    getAcsToken(): Observable<AcsUser> {
        return this.http.get<AcsUser>(this.apiUrl + 'acstoken')
        .pipe(
            catchError(this.handleError)
        );
    }
    ```

1. An API server function named `createACSToken()` retrieves the userId and access token and returns it to the client. It can be found in the *server/typescript/acs.ts* file. 

    ```typescript
    import { CommunicationIdentityClient } from '@azure/communication-identity';
 
    const connectionString = process.env.ACS_CONNECTION_STRING as string;

    async function createACSToken() {
    if (!connectionString) return { userId: '', token: '' };

    const tokenClient = new CommunicationIdentityClient(connectionString);
    const { user, token } = await tokenClient.createUserAndToken(["voip"]);
    return { userId: user.communicationUserId, token };
    }
    ```

    This function performs the following actions:

    - Checks if an ACS `connectionString` value is available. If not, returns an object with an empty `userId` and `token`.
    - Creates a new instance of `CommunicationIdentityClient` and passes the `connectionString` value to it.
    - Creates a new user and token using `tokenClient.createUserAndToken()` with the "voip" scope.
    - Returns an object containing the `userId` and `token` values.

1. Now that you've seen how the userId and token are retrieved, go back to `phone-call.component.ts` and locate the `startCall()` function. 

1. This function is called when **Call** is selected in the phone call component. It uses the `CallAgent` object mentioned earlier to start a call. The `callAgent.startCall()` function accepts an object representing the number to call and the ACS phone number used to make the call.

    ```typescript
    startCall() {
        this.call = this.callAgent?.startCall(
            [{ phoneNumber: this.customerPhoneNumber }], {
            alternateCallerId: { phoneNumber: this.fromNumber }
        });
        console.log('Calling: ', this.customerPhoneNumber);
        console.log('Call id: ', this.call?.id);
        this.inCall = true;

        // Adding event handlers to monitor call state
        this.call?.on('stateChanged', () => {
            console.log('Call state changed: ', this.call?.state);
            if (this.call?.state === 'Disconnected') {
                console.log('Call ended. Reason: ', this.call.callEndReason);
                this.inCall = false;
            }
        });
    }
    ```

1. The `endCall()` function is called when **Hang Up** is selected in the phone call component.

    ```typescript
    endCall() {
        if (this.call) {
            this.call.hangUp({ forEveryone: true });
            this.call = undefined;
            this.inCall = false;
        }
        else {
            this.hangup.emit();
        }
    }
    ```

    If a call is in progress, the `call.hangUp()` function is called to end the call. If no call is in progress, the `hangup` event is emitted to the header parent component to hide the phone call component.

1. Before moving on to the next exercise, let's review the key concepts covered in this exercise:

    - An ACS userId and access token are retrieved from the API server using the `acsService.createUserAndToken()` function. 
    - The token is used to create a `CallClient` and `CallAgent` object.
    - The `CallAgent` object is used to start and end a call by calling the `callAgent.startCall()` and `callAgent.hangUp()` functions respectively.

1. Now that you've learned how phone calling can be integrated into an application, let's switch our focus to using Azure Communication Services to send email and SMS messages.
