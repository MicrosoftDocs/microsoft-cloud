**Figure 10: The Microsoft Cloud provides a unified set of services that applications can use.**

The Microsoft Cloud, shown once more in Figure 10, provides a broad set of useful services to support custom applications. Building on this foundation can help you:

- Create better applications in less time with pro-code development on Azure and low-code development on Power Platform.
- Get the most value from technical talent with fusion development and an integrated low-code and pro-code development process that includes GitHub and Azure DevOps.
- Integrate new applications with existing solutions by using Azure API Management, Microsoft Graph, and Dynamics 365.
- Create and run secure applications by using Active Directory for identity and access management.

  Use Azure Sentinel for security information and event management (SIEM), and for security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR).
